// Or use bookeo?
// Does bookeo include comprehensive checkout system?
// *** Xola is another option for booking and checkout ***

// Original application will require:
    // Calendar system which includes all possible reservations as booked or available
    // Live-updated record of all bookings in both front and backend
    // Checkout system with all payment methods usable
    // Business-side portal for employees and management
    // Statistcal details for record-keeping, stats and relevant data
